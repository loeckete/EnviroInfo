Today we are going to explore a couple of different approaches to 
extracting (a.k.a., scraping) data from on-line sources. For 
example tables or text.
First we will work through an example posted on R-blogger to 
scrape citation data from google scholar.  This example uses the
rvest package, which depends on "Piping".
